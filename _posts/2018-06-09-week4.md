#### Fourth Week: Frontend for Console Commands, Admin Permissions
This week consisted entirely of working on the frontend and backend for console commands and admin permissions.

[Frontend for Console Commands](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/6){:.gh-pr} \\
![FrontendConsoleCommands]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ConsoleCommandFrontend.PNG) \\
These commands allow for easier user management than manually using the console.
Unfortunately, the way most console commands are programmed means that there needs to be a client connected to the game for execution.
The only commands that work on the server are user management commands.

[Backend for Admin Permissions](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/17){:.gh-pr} \\
A new file, similar to the already existing serverAdmins.json, holds the permissions for admins.
The following resources were added to the REST API with this PR:
* resources/serverAdminPermissions; GET gives the contents of serverAdminPermissions.json
* resources/serverAdmins/{adminId}/permissions; GET gives the permissions in JSON form of the admin's permissions, PATCH changes the permissions. \\
The admin permissions system makes it so that some admins are blocked from taking certain actions. \\

Here we can see a list of permissions.
If an admin tries to access a command and they are not allowed to, then the server will give them an access forbidden message.
At the moment, the actual permissions are hardcoded, and most of the logic preventing access is hardcoded as well.

The individual permissions for each admin can be seen here.

[Frontend for Admin Permissions](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/7){:.gh-pr} \\
![AdminPermissionManagement]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/AdminPermissionManagement.PNG) \\
This frontend change is mostly just to allow a place to change the permissions.
At the moment, the only thing done is the UI and getting the data into a variable on the frontend, while the actual logic is currenly in progress.

Next week is a buffer week that will consist of finishing up all the tasks for month 1.
Admin permissions should be done early in the week.
Hopefully packaging will be completed by then, and ideally there will be enough documentation.
Another goal will be to update the version of ReactXP so that we can use the requestFocus() method to keep focus on the console command execution input.

#### Eleventh Week: World Map, Blacklist/Whitelist, Frontend Console
This week was mostly full of personal stuff that prevented me from doing much work. 
\\
[Add Server Facade to Omega Distribution](https://github.com/Terasology/Index/pull/2){:.gh-pr} \\
Since the jopenvr issue that was blocking progress on this was
[resolved](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/23) last week, this was merged.
\\
[Backend for Blacklist and Whitelist](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/22){:.gh-pr} \\
No changes, but merged.
\\
[Frontend for Blacklist and Whitelist](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/9){:.gh-pr} \\
After the redesign of the prompt last week, the challenge switched to trying to refresh the prompt. I found a solution
to the problem by closing and reopening the prompt instantly. This worked, but it wouldn't refresh for other clients
when something was changed. My mentor, Gianluca Nitii, figured out a way to refresh the prompt from the server by
making a function variable in the user management tab's state that can be called by the user management tab model.
The blacklist/whitelist prompt sets the state of the tab so that the function variable is a refresh function in the
prompt.
\\
[Make the Frontend Execute Server Commands Only](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/10){:.gh-pr} \\
Ultimately it was decided that a server-only solution would work better, so this was closed.
\\
[Resource for Console Help Text](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/24){:.gh-pr} \\
Instead of just being used for the help text, this PR now does everything for the frontend. The work done here is mostly
copy-pasting code from the frontend to the backend under the console resource and translating it into Java.
\\
[Unit Tests](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/25){:.gh-pr} \\
This PR adds unit tests, so far only the system resource is done.
\\
Again, I didn't have much time to do work, which is why there isn't much for this week. Next week is the last week in
GSoC, so I want to finish adding unit tests and documentation. I will add unit tests to all new features I added over
GSoC, and possibly other things if it looks like they are needed. As for documentation, I already fully documented all
of the new code I added, so I might add documentation for end-users to reference. If I finish these completely in the
next week, I will work on the stretch goal of adding a config system to the facade server backend.

#### Second Week: First Addition to the Backend/Frontend, Documentation, Launcher Packaging, and Autocomplete
This week was the first full week of work. Most of the week was dedicated to getting the system status on the REST API and on the frontend,
while some other time was also put into adding documentation and looking into packaging with the launcher.

In the meeting on Sunday, it was ultimately decided that [SIGAR](https://github.com/hyperic/sigar) was not the best choice due to it requiring additional natives.
Instead, we opted for [Oshi](https://github.com/oshi/oshi), which gives what we need without requiring any external additions.
Oshi does have a dependency in JNA, but the engine already requires JNA, so nothing needs to be added.
The version of JNA used by the engine is outdated, so I had to use a somewhat outdated version of Oshi.
In the end, the information transmitted over REST consists of CPU usage, memory usage, and memory max.
By using the built in [Runtime](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html) and [RuntimeMXBean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/management/RuntimeMXBean.html) classes, the REST API also receives the jvm memory usage/maximum as well as the jvm uptime (meaning server uptime).

[Code for the frontend PR](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/3){:.gh-pr} \\
![FrontendSystemStatus]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CPUMemoryFrontend.PNG) \\
The frontend implementation for system status is fairly simple. Most of it is just displaying and formatting text from the backend.
The other parts of the code are mostly just fitting it into the abstractions.

I am also adding bits of javadoc to the backend classes when I have some spare time.
The javadoc might be done before the next week, and a PR should come up soon.

Console command autocomplete is currently in progress for next week, and should be done before the week ends. If there is time, some work will be put into packaging, assuming that the Jenkins build for the server facade works by then. \\
The approach that I plan on taking for autocomplete starts with exposing a list of console commands through a GET request:
![ConsoleCommands]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/ConsoleCommands.PNG) \\
(the text might be a bit too small, but it is a list of all available console commands.) \\
I have already gotten this data across to the frontend, and now my goal is to emulate the relevant parts of [CyclingTabCompletionEngine](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/develop/engine/src/main/java/org/terasology/logic/console/ui/CyclingTabCompletionEngine.java)
to make the console commands. The frontend is written in typescript while the tab completion code is in Java, so I will have to do a bit of work converting it.
  
For packaging, the first goal will be to add an option to the launcher settings allowing running the game with the facade server. \\
![LauncherServerOption]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/NewLauncherSetting.png) \\
We need to be able to download the server facade from a source (which will be Jenkins for now) and then run it.
Once the Jenkins build starts working, I will begin work on the launcher to make it work.

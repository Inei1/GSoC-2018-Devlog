### Summary of the first month:

##### week 1
[Logout Button](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/2){:.gh-pr} \\
Adds a logout button to the frontend. Currently only refreshes the page.

Also, a lot of packaging stuff has been done over the weeks, starting from week 1.

##### week 2
[System Status Backend](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/13){:.gh-pr} \\
[System Status Frontend](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/3){:.gh-pr} \\
Adds information on the system running the server to the REST API, including CPU usage, RAM usage, and server uptime. \\
[Javadoc for the Backend](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/15){:.gh-pr} (ongoing) \\
Adds a bunch of Javadoc to the backend code so that it is easier to work with.

##### week 3
[Console Autocomplete Backend](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/16){:.gh-pr} \\
[Console Autocomplete Frontend](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/6){:.gh-pr} \\
Allows pressing tab to autocomplete commands for the frontend.

##### week 4
[Backend for Admin Permissions](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/17){:.gh-pr} \\
[Frontend for Admin Permission](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/7){:.gh-pr} \\
Implements a new system where some admins can be restricted from certain actions.

#### Fifth Week: Admin Permissions, Packaging, and First Evaluation
Work this week was mostly on admin permissions and a bit of work put into packaging.

[Backend for Admin Permissions](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/17){:.gh-pr} \\
This PR, opened late last week, is now close to being finished, with some refactoring close to completion.
It blocks admins from performing actions using the serverAdminPermissions.json file:
![AdminPermissionsFile]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/serverAdminPermissionsJSON.PNG) \\
With the recent refactoring, admin permissions are integrated into the rest of the system, where individual resources can specify what permissions they require.

[Frontend for Admin Permissions](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/7){:.gh-pr} \\
Coming from last week, the changes done have finalized the logic required for the frontend.
All that has been done is simply creating a UI and sending/receiving data relating to admin permissions through the REST API.

As for packaging, almost everything seems to have been figured out.
I have managed to successfully run the server within the Omega distribution after manually copying some files in.
These files could probably be added in automatically without too much difficulty.

First, the facade server jar needed to be changed to include the classpath:

```build.gradle (under Server Facade)```
```
jar {
    manifest {
        attributes("Main-Class" : mainClassName)
        attributes("Class-Path" : configurations.runtime.collect { it.getName() }.join(" "))
    }
}
```

This change makes the jar read in the libraries of the server facade.
To run the facade in the Omega distribution, I made a batch file (for Windows only) that runs the facade and stores the saves in the correct directory:

```run_facade_server_windows.bat```
```
java -Xms128m -Xmx1536m -jar libs/FacadeServer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -homedir="C:\Users\PCUser4\Saved Games\Terasology\server"
REM Alternatively use our Launcher from: https://github.com/MovingBlocks/TerasologyLauncher/releases
```

At the moment, there is still a bug, where running the server creates an empty rendering config file in the game directory.
To copy in the files, I have experimented with the distros.gradle file used to make the Omega distribution:

```distros.gradle```
```
configurations {
    // ...
    facades {
        description = 'Facades with dependencies'
    }
}

dependencies {
    // ...
	if (project.hasProperty('useFacadeServer') && project.property('useFacadeServer') == "true") {
        logger.lifecycle("Extra facade: Server")
        dependencies {
            facades(group: 'org.terasology.web', name: 'FacadeServer', version: '+')
        }
	} else {
        logger.info "Not using Facade Server"
    }
}

task distroPC (type: Zip) {
    description = "Adds modules to a PC distribution of the game. Exact modules are declared in a distro dir like iota"
    // ...
    // We also want to add the facades given by the gradle.properties file
    from(configurations.facades) {
        into "libs"
    }
}
```

To accompany this, there is a change in the gradle.properties for the omega distribution:

```gradle.properties```
```
extraModules=AdditionalFruits,AdditionalItemPipes,AdditionalRails...

useFacadeServer=true
```

With all this said, the Facade Server and all its dependencies increase the size of the Omega distribution by about 30MB.
Maybe it would be better to create a new distribution for this instead of changing the Omega distribution.

#### Seventh Week: World Map and Packaging
Work this week consisted of conceptualizing and executing the world map and working on packaging.
For packaging, I opened what should be the last PR to change the Omega distribution.
I also made a working version of the world map resource, which displays a part of the game world.
\\
[Modifying the ServerFacade Jar](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/20){:.gh-pr} \\
It turns out that I put the launch scripts folder into the wrong directory in last week's packaging PR.
This PR moved the launch scripts into src/main/resources so that they would be included in the jar.
\\
[Change the Omega distribution to contain the server facade](https://github.com/Terasology/Index/pull/2){:.gh-pr} \\
Changes in this PR modify the Omega distribution with an additional property and some gradle code to declare the
server facade as a dependency. The server facade is declared as a dependency so that it and all its dependencies are
automatically downloaded when trying to build the Omega distribution. Aside from that, another part of the code
takes all files in the server facade dependency, then filters out anything that isn't in the launch scripts directory.
The result of this is that the contents of the launchScripts directory are copied into the omega distribution.
\\
[Backend for the World Map](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/21){:.gh-pr} \\
The current setup for this uses a center location to search from along with a block length and width to display a map.
A 2D array is sent across the REST API, containing the names of all blocks found through the WorldProvider class.
This uses the coordinates provided from the frontend.
Optionally, the y coordinate of the surface can be found using methods similar to the how the Minimap module does it.
The texture for each block is then found, and then the rgb value of each pixel in the block is averaged to give a color.
This color of the block is then matched to the name of the block and sent across as a look-up table for the frontend
to use in displaying.
However, there is currently a big problem with how the blocks are obtained in the world.
The blocks have to be loaded to get any data on them, which means that there has to be someone connected to the game
with a regular client to load the blocks so that we can get the names and textures of the blocks.
\\
[Frontend for the World Map](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/8){:.gh-pr} \\
The frontend is used to send information to the server on where to display the map.
Once the data is processed on the server, the server then gives data to build the map.
Right now, the colors are rendered as a 2D array of ReactXP ImageSVGs that are squares with a single fill color.
This works, but it is really inefficient and causes a lot of lag.
\\
Now for some screenshots:
![First World Map]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/WorldMapFirst1.PNG) \\
This shows the world map at y coordinate 35 compared to the real game.
\\
![Second World Map]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/WorldMapSecond.PNG) \\
This is the same area where the y coordinate is always at the surface, more like a minimap.
The image might actually be incorrect due to a bug.
\\
Next week will consist of more progress on the world map resource.
My goal is to add a sort of brightness level for blocks that are on different elevations.
There is already an implementation of this in the Minimap module that I can copy.

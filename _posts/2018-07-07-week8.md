#### Eighth Week: World Map
Work this week consisted of improving the world map. Additions include modifying the brightness of certain parts of the
texture depending on a block's y coordinate, changing the way of sending the image data over REST to be base64 encoded,
and bug fixing/testing.
\\
[Backend for the World Map](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/21){:.gh-pr} \\
The first new commit here refactored the WorldMapResource class to have all the functionality of WorldMapMetadata,
and WorldMapMetadata was deleted. It also drastically improved the performance by creating the image on the backend
instead of the frontend. Instead of sending an array of blocks and a lookup table for the colors for the frontend to
display, the backend just creates a BufferedImage instead. This BufferedImage uses the colors it obtained from the
blocks to build an image with a bunch of rectangles, then the BufferedImage is encoded into a base64 string and sent
across the REST API to be displayed by the frontend. The second commit changed the getRGB function into a function that
also takes the y-coordinate into account to darken the colors, where lower is darker.
\\
[Frontend for the World Map](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer-frontend/pull/8){:.gh-pr} \\
The changes here were made to keep the frontend working correctly with the backend. More specifically, the display area
of the world map image is now just an RX.Image tag, where the source is the base64 encoded image.

Here is an image of the world with the center at (0, 0, 0) and a width/height of 250.

For next week, the goal is to finish up the world map by adding some way to load the blocks in the world from the
frontend without having to connect to the game with a normal client. After that is done, if any bugs are present then
they will be worked on. It is likely that these tasks will be done before the week is over, and I will work on adding
server blacklist/whitelist support to the frontend. I already added support for these to the engine before GSoC started,
so it should be almost trivial to add some new buttons to the user management tab with this functionality, as long as
the blacklist/whitelist code works correctly.

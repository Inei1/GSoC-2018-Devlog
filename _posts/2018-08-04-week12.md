#### Twelfth Week: World Map, Blacklist/Whitelist, Frontend Console
This week, I decided to work less because I already finished all of my normal goals. There are still some stretch
goals to do.
\\
[Resource for Console Help Text](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/24){:.gh-pr} \\
Merged.
\\
[Unit Tests](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/25){:.gh-pr} \\
All of the classes that can reasonably be tested have been finished.
\\
As for the documentation for new features, I already did it all while I wrote the classes. As said before, all tasks
have been done, although I still have some stretch goals to work on. I plan on writing an user's
guide or something similar at some point. There are a few things with the UX on the frontend that I would like to change.
Other than that, in the next weeks I could work on some of my stretch goals.
